- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
Java is alright, I am still getting used to it of course. I could understand why people would want to use Java instead of Python though.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
They both have methods. You have to use curly brackets in Java compared to the semicolon in Python, so the syntax is different in both. I think that the programmer has to really know what they want to code when using Java because it is more specific in terms of specifying data types. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What worked was looking through the rubric and readme and looking through the Java documentation.
I struggled with creating the transcript and the canned responses.
TA hours/being surrounded by other people working on the same assignment helps a lot.
